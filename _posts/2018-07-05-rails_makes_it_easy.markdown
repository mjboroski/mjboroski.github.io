Admittedly, the complexity of an entirely new framework can be intimidating. Rails was no exception. There was a lot to take in, from routes to params to forms and more. Everything seemed to make sense on the first run through, but towards the end, I started to have to put it all together. Things were hard until I realized how easy they were. Rails is fantastic.

I chose to create an employee/employer benefit enrollment program.  This allows workers to choose their personal benefits and enroll or unenroll from them. I had a difficult time trying to remove a single entry from a join table, "Selections." After a lot of trial and error, everything eventually clicked as I found my groove manipulating the DOM through the streamlined processes of Rails. This project gave me a chance to really work with manipulating the elements within the Bootstrap framework as well. It was good to get something up and running with proper authentication and administrative access limitations. I'm happy to say I now realize the potential here for building complex applications.
