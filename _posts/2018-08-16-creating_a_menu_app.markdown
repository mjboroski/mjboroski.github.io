The idea is simple: If you were a chef and could load a list of available ingredients into an app, you could choose a personal selection and create a menu item with it. If you could save that item, you could revisit your recipe in the future. In this assesment, I used a Rails back-end with a React front-end and Redux middleware. I found React to be as intuitive as Rails after working with it for a while. Tying them together seemed to be the trickiest part, as I wasn't shown an example of this until given a blog post with my final project. 

Ideally, I'd like to eventually expand this app. I could see it utilizing the underlying technology to expand endlessly. With enough modification, I could even turn this into an API for restaurant menus, but initially, that is too far beyond the scope of what I currently know. I'd like to learn more about integrating QR codes and applying that technology to this sort of idea, allowing people to save orders to any restaurant on their phones.
