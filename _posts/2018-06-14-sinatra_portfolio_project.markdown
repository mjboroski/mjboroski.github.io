For my portfolio project, I chose to do something that I could use in the future. I created a central bookmark repository called Bookmarker. I found this exercise in routing and data management could be extremely useful as a basic foundation for a wide variety of possible projects. I leaned heavily on information learned while creating the fwitter mockup in the lesson prior to this. One frustration i had with fwitter was the user experience. For the app, I chose to create a better user experience by using a greater amount of cross-linking between different routes where appropriate. 

In the past, I  have had experience with AngularJS and i found the basic MVC architecture to be very familiar. Passing modelled objects intelligently through the controllers to create views based on relevant information seems intuitive as a standard for web development. This is likely why it has become so widespread.

I found the shotgun command and corresponding sinatra errors in the browser to be a simplistic, yet highly effective way to debug once the framework of the program was up and running. In fact, I prefer to debug this way when possible. I believe the most useful thing gleaned from this project was the ability to widely incorporate injected Ruby code. The sheer power of merging multiple code bases almost seems like cheating when compared to trying to do everything in one language.
